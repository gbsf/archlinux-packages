    ==> PHP modules

    PHP has been built with optional modules. To enable these modules,
    uncomment the modules from php.ini

    Some of them require extra packages to be installed:

        * bz2                : bzip2
        * curl               : curl
        * dba                : gdbm
        * gd                 : libpng, libjpeg, freetype2
        * imap               : pam
        * ldap               : libldap
        * mcrypt             : mcrypt, libtool
        * mysql/mysqli       : libmysqlclient
        * odbc/pdo_odbc      : unixodbc
        * openssl            : openssl
        * pgsql/pdo_pgsql    : postgresql-libs
        * pspell             : aspell
        * snmp               : net-snmp
        * sqlite             : sqlite3
        * tidy               : tidyhtml
        * xsl                : libxslt

    ==> PHP-CGI and FCGI

    There are several cgi relevant settings in your php.ini. Make sure to
    adjust them according to your needs. At least you should activate the
    cgi.fix_pathinfo directive in php.ini by uncommenting it.

    ==> Location of php.ini has changed

    A previous configuration was found at /etc/php.ini. PHP stores its
    configuration at /etc/php/ now. Your old php.ini was moved to
    /etc/php/php.ini. You should merge your old file with the
    default one that can be found at /etc/php/php.ini.pacnew.

    Make sure to enable the modules you need. A lot of them are shared
    objects now and not statically built into php.

    External modules store their configuration in /etc/php/conf.d/. PHP
    scans that directory for any ini files.
